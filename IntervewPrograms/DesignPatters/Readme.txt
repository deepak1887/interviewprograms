1. Design patterns(what and why)
	a. Design pattern in object oriented programming world helps the developers to make a 
	   better software design.
	b. Design pattern provide solutions to real wold softeare application design problems 
	   or in application development.
	c. Design pattern are about applying reusable design and interactions of objects.
	d. Design pattern provide flexible solutions to solve common design problem in real world.
	e. writing the code with design patterns will make your applications more Reliable, Scalable
	   and maintainable.
	f. A pattern is a recurring solution to a problem in a context.
2. Design Pattern History
3. Types of design pattern

4. Design pattern classification
	a. Creational (provides mechanism of various object creation, reducing code and increasing 
					flexibility)
					1. Abstract
					2. builder
					3. Factory method
					4. Prototype
					5. Singleton
	b. Structural (create and implement flexible and efficient structures and how to assemble 
					classes into larger structure)
					1. Adapter
					2. Bridge
					3. Composite
					4. Decotator
					5. Facade
					6. Flyweight
					7. Proxy
	c. Behavioral (Object behaviour and responsibilities berween objects are very important,
					concerned with algorithms)
					1. Chain
					2. Command
					3. Interpreter
					4. Iterator
					5. Mediator
					6. Memento
					7. Observer
					8. State
					9. Strategy
					10. Template Method
					11. Visitor
5. When to apply
6. For basic understanding about the object oriented concepts:
	1. Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation
	2. Interfaces, Classes, Abstract classes
